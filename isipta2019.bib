	abstract = {I argue that natural selection sometimes depends on objective imprecise probabilities. I give a general argument for the existence of objective imprecise probabilities. I then argue that natural selection, whether involving objective imprecise probabilities or not, would give rise to organisms whose behavior was imprecisely probabilistic, and that this would mean that other organisms’ environments were imprecisely probabilistic. Since natural selection can be influenced by the environment, it therefore sometimes depends on objective imprecise probability. I explain why the absence of reports of objective imprecise probability in evolution is nevertheless unsurprising, and provide illustrations of ways to model natural selection with objective imprecise probabilities.},

This allows for a compact representation of joint mass functions consistent with logical constraints. We propose a <em>credal</em> generalisation of the probabilistic quantification of these models, that allows to replace the local probabilities with (credal) sets of mass functions specified by linear constraints. This induces a joint credal set, that sharply assigns probability zero to states inconsistent with the constraints. These models can support cautious estimates of the local parameters when only small amounts of training data are available. Algorithmic strategies to compute lower and upper bounds of marginal and conditional queries are provided. The task can be achieved in linear time with respect to the diagram size for marginal queries. The same can be done for conditional queries if the topology of the circuit is singly connected.},

For concise representation of such a relation, a subset of its triplets is listed in a so-called basis; its other triplets are defined implicitly through a set of axioms. An elementary-triplet basis for this purpose consists of all elementary triplets of a relation. Such a basis however, may include redundant information. In this paper we provide two lower bounds on the size of an elementary-triplet basis in general and an upper bound on the size of a minimum elementary-triplet basis.

The model delivers <em>cautious</em> predictions, in form of set-valued class, in case of limited or imperfect available information. Experiments show that including an imprecise component in the Gaussian discriminant analysis produces reasonably cautious predictions, in the sense that the number of set-valued predictions is not too high, and that those predictions correspond to hard-to-classify instances, that is instances for which the precise classifier accuracy drops.},

Acknowledging the importance of (i) taking into account all sources of relevant information in a given problem and (ii) controlling error probabilities, the present paper provides insights on how to incorporate partial priors “as they are”. This incorporation is guided by desired properties, such as that correct partial priors should result in more efficient inferences and, most importantly, that the inferences are always calibrated, independent of the truthfulness of the partial prior.},

If the belief function reference lotteries we use are Bayesian belief functions, then our representation theorem coincides with Jaffray’s representation theorem for his linear utility theory for belief functions. We illustrate our framework using some examples discussed in the literature. Finally, we compare our decision theory with those proposed by Jaffray and Smets.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes the robust Bayes Factor as a direct generalization of the conventional Bayes Factor for a special case of independent two-sample comparisons. Such comparisons are of great importance in psychological research, and more generally wherever the scientific endeavour is to ascertain a potential group effect. The conventional Bayes Factor as the ratio of the marginal likelihoods under two considered hypotheses demands for a precise, subjective specification of the prior distribution for the parameter of interest. Thus, it lacks the possibility of incorporating prior knowledge that is only available partially. Drawing on the theory of Imprecise Probabilities, the <em>robust</em> Bayes Factor is presented in view of lifting the restrictions on the specification of the prior distribution as being precise. In practice, the robust Bayes Factor approach enables an analyst to specify hyperparameter <em>intervals</em>, whose lengths correspond to the degree of subjective prior uncertainty. Based thereon, a set of (infinitely) many subjective prior distributions is established to substitute one precise prior distribution. Finally, the robust Bayes Factor is defined as an interval, bounded by the minimal and the maximal resultant Bayes Factor values. Latter are obtained by optimizing the conventional Bayes Factor over the predefined set of prior distributions. This explicit incorporation of incomplete prior knowledge increases the feasibility of applying a Bayesian approach to hypothesis comparisons in scientific practice. It reduces error-proneness, enables for an inclusion of multiple perspectives and encourages cautious, more realistic conclusions in hypothesis comparisons.},

Motivated by the use of confidence by the IPCC and US Defense Intelligence Agency in their assessments of uncertainty, the paper then considers the consequences of the proposed approach for uncertainty reporting. On the one hand, when connected to decision, the model affords a clear separation of the belief and value factors: an important quality in policy making contexts where these are the responsibility of different actors. On the other hand, the issue of inter-agent confidence calibration is discussed, and a calibration scale is proposed and defended, on the basis of weight-of-evidence version of David Lewis’s Principal Principle.},

In each of them there exists quite a number of choices and most of the decisions are effected by uncertainties and preferences, from choosing a healthy lunch and nice clothes to choosing a profession and a field of study. Uncertainties can be modeled by probabilities and preferences by utilities. A rational decision maker prefers to make a decision with the least regret or the most satisfaction. The principle of maximum expected utility can be helpful in this issue. Expected utility deals with problems in which agents make a decision under conditions in which probabilities of states play a role in the choice, as well as the utilities of outcomes. Argumentation formalisms could be an option to model these problems and to pick one or several alternatives. In this paper, a new argument-based framework, numerical abstract dialectical frameworks (nADFs for short), is introduced to do so. First, the semantics of this formalism, which is a generalization of abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs for short), based on many-valued interpretations are introduced, including preferred, grounded, complete and model-based semantics. Second, it is shown how nADFs are expressive enough to formalize standard decision problems. It is shown that the different types of semantics of an nADF that is associated with a decision problem all coincide and have the standard meaning. In this way, it is shown how the nADF semantics can be used to choose the best set of decisions.},

Traditional Bayesian methods can be justified using epistemic scoring rules, which measure the accuracy of the estimates that they produce. But there has been little work extending these justifications to the IP framework. This paper makes plea for the IP community to embrace this research programme. The plea comes in three parts. Firstly, I outline some initial work developing scoring rules for imprecise probabilities --- IP scoring rules --- and using them to shore up the philosophical foundations of IP. Secondly, I explain why a range of impossibility results for IP scoring rules should <em>not</em> dissuade the IP community from working on the foundations of IP scoring rules.

	abstract = {In classification, it is often preferable to assign a pattern to a set of classes when the uncertainty is too high to make a precise decision. In this paper, we consider the problem of making set-valued predictions in classification tasks, when uncertainty is described by belief functions. Two approaches are contrasted. In the first one, an act is defined as the assignment to only one class, and we define a partial preorder among acts. The set of non-dominated acts is then given as the prediction. In the second approach, an act is defined as the assignment to a set of classes, and we construct a complete preorder among acts. The two approaches are discussed and compared experimentally. A critical issue both to make decisions and to evaluate decision rules is to define the utility of set-valued prediction. To this end, we propose to model the decision maker’s attitude towards imprecision using an Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) operator, which allows us to extend the utility matrix. An experimental comparison of different decision rules is performed using UCI and artificial Gaussian data sets.},

	abstract = {An inferential model encodes the data analyst’s degrees of belief about an unknown quantity of interest based on the observed data, posited statistical model, etc. Inferences drawn based on these degrees of belief should be reliable in a certain sense, so we require the inferential model to be <em>valid</em>. The construction of valid inferential models based on individual pieces of data is relatively straightforward, but how to combine these so that the validity property is preserved? In this paper we analyze some common combination rules with respect to this question, and we conclude that the best strategy currently available is one that combines via a certain dimension reduction step before the inferential model construction.},

Less familiar, however, is the quantification of uncertainty about the models themselves. A Bayesian approach provides a posterior distribution for the model but it comes with no validity guarantees, and, therefore, is only suited for ranking and selection. In this paper, I will present an alternative way to view this model uncertainty problem, through the lens of a valid inferential model based on random sets and non-additive beliefs. Specifically, I will show that valid uncertainty quantification about a model is attainable within this framework in general, and highlight the benefits in a classical signal detection problem.},

We also compare them in terms of a number of properties: precision, number of extreme points, n-monotonicity, … thus providing possible guidelines to pick a neighbourhood rather than another.},

However, most often relevant information about the phenomenon of interest is available only imprecisely, and misleading results might be obtained, in particular, by either ignoring relevant information or pretending a level of knowledge that is not given. In order to be able to include (partial) information authentically in the imprecise form it is available, this paper tries to extend the framework of hypothesis-based Bayesian decision making with simple hypotheses to be able to deal with imprecise information about the three relevant quantities: hypotheses, prior beliefs, and loss function. Although straightforward at first glance, it appears that by specifying the hypotheses imprecisely, Bayesian updating of the prior beliefs might be inconsistent. In that, this paper provides the basic mathematical formulation to further extend imprecise hypothesis-based Bayesian decision theory to more elaborate contexts, such as those involving composite imprecise hypotheses, and in addition highlights the necessity of paying particular attention to the depicted updating issues.},

Often imprecise probabilistic models and also sets of operators need to be extended to larger domains. Such extensions are especially interesting when some kind of independence requirements have to be taken into account. The goal of this paper is to propose extension methods for sets of Markov operators that are consistent with the existing extension methods for imprecise probabilistic models. The main focus is on extensions satisfying epistemic irrelevance. We propose a new general approach to extending sets of desirable gambles, called <em>additive independent extension</em>, which subsumes important types of extensions, such as epistemic irrelevance and marginal extension. This approach is then extended to sets of Markov operators, so that the extensions are consistent with those of sets of desirable gambles.},

Subsequently, we show that the most conservative upper expectation satisfying our axioms coincides with a particular version of the game-theoretic upper expectation introduced by Shafer and Vovk. This has two important implications. On the one hand, it guarantees that there is a unique most conservative global belief model satisfying our axioms. On the other hand, it shows that Shafer and Vovk’s model can be given an axiomatic characterisation, thereby providing an alternative motivation for adopting this model, even outside their framework.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a method for fitting a two-state imprecise Markov chain to time series data from a two-state non-Markovian process. Such non-Markovian processes are common in practical applications. We focus on how to fit modelling parameters based on data from a process where time to transition is not exponentially distributed, thereby violating the Markov assumption. We do so by first fitting a many-state (i.e. having more than two states) Markov chain to the data, through its associated phase-type distribution. Then, we lump the process to a two-state imprecise Markov chain. In practical applications, a two-state imprecise Markov chain might be more convenient than a many-state Markov chain, as we have closed analytic expressions for typical quantities of interest (including the lower and upper expectation of any function of the state at any point in time). A numerical example demonstrates how the entire inference process (fitting and prediction) can be done using Markov chain Monte Carlo, for a given set of prior distributions on the parameters. In particular, we numerically identify the set of posterior densities and posterior lower and upper expectations on all model parameters and predictive quantities. We compare our inferences under a range of sample sizes and model assumptions.},

The imprecision of the tree estimates is defined by means of imprecise statistical inference models and interval models.

Due to the high number of parameters, SPNs learned from data can produce unreliable and overconfident inference; this phenomenon can be partially mitigated by performing a Robustness Analysis of the model predictions to changes in the parameters.
