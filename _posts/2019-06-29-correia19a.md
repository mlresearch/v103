title: An Experimental Study of Prior Dependence in Bayesian Network Structure Learning
abstract: The Bayesian Dirichlet equivalent uniform (BDeu) function is a popular score
  to evaluate the goodness of a Bayesian network structure given complete categorical
  data. Despite its interesting properties, such as likelihood equivalence, it does
  require a prior expressed via a user-defined parameter known as Equivalent Sample
  Size (ESS), which significantly affects the final structure. We study conditions
  to obtain prior independence in BDeu-based structure learning. We show in experiments
  that the amount of data needed to render the learning robust to different ESS values
  is prohibitively large, even in big data times.
