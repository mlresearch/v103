title: On Minimum Elementary-Triplet Bases for Independence Relations
abstract: A semi-graphoid independence relation is a set of independence statements,
  called triplets, and is typically exponentially large in the number of variables
  involved. For concise representation of such a relation, a subset of its triplets
  is listed in a so-called basis; its other triplets are defined implicitly through
  a set of axioms. An elementary-triplet basis for this purpose consists of all elementary
  triplets of a relation. Such a basis however, may include redundant information.
  In this paper we provide two lower bounds on the size of an elementary-triplet basis
  in general and an upper bound on the size of a minimum elementary-triplet basis.
  We further specify the construction of an elementary-triplet basis of minimum size
  for restricted relations.
