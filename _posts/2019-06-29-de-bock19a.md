abstract: 'The ISIPTA meetings are the primary forum for presenting and discussing
  advances in imprecise probabilities research. They are organized once every two
  years by SIPTA, the Society for Imprecise Probabilities: Theories and Applications.
  The first meeting was held in Ghent in 1999. It was followed by meetings in Ithaca,
  Lugano, Pittsburgh, Prague, Durham, Innsbruck, Compi√®gne, Pescara and Lugano. After
  twenty years, we return to Ghent for the <em>11th International Symposium on Imprecise
  Probabilities: Theories and Applications</em>. This anniversary edition will be
