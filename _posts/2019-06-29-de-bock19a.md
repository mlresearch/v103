abstract: 'The ISIPTA meetings are the primary forum for presenting and discussing
  advances in imprecise probabilities research. They are organized once every two
  years by SIPTA, the Society for Imprecise Probabilities: Theories and Applications.
  The first meeting was held in Ghent in 1999. It was followed by meetings in Ithaca,
  Lugano, Pittsburgh, Prague, Durham, Innsbruck, Compiègne, Pescara and Lugano. After
  twenty years, we return to Ghent for the <em>11th International Symposium on Imprecise
  Probabilities: Theories and Applications</em>. This anniversary edition will be
  held from Wednesday 3 to Saturday 6 July 2019.'
