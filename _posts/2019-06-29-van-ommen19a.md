title: Robust Causal Domain Adaptation in a Simple Diagnostic Setting
abstract: Causal domain adaptation approaches aim to find statistical relations in
  a source domain, that will still hold in a target domain, using the assumption that
  a common causal graph underlies both domains. For many such problems, the available
  information is insufficient to uniquely identify the target domain distribution,
  and we find a set of distributions instead. We propose to use a worst-case approach,
  picking an action that performs well against all distributions in this set. In this
  paper, we study a specific diagnostic instance of this problem, and find a sufficient
  and necessary condition that characterizes the worst-case distribution in the target
  domain. We find that the Brier and logarithmic scores lead to different distributions,
  and consequently to different recommendations for the decision maker.
