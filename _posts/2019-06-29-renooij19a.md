title: On Intercausal Interactions in Probabilistic Relational Models
abstract: Probabilistic relational models (PRMs) extend Bayesian networks beyond propositional
  expressiveness by allowing the representation of multiple interacting classes. For
  a specific instance of sets of concrete objects per class, a ground Bayesian network
  is composed by replicating parts of the PRM. The interactions between the objects
  that are thereby induced, are not always obvious from the PRM. We demonstrate in
  this paper that the replicative structure of the ground network in fact constrains
  the space of possible probability distributions and thereby the possible patterns
  of intercausal interaction.
